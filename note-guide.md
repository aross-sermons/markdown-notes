## Note Metadata
**YAML Headers** - The YAML header above is to prefix every note and include relationships (not seen here).
## Note Structure
### Content Organization
**Headers and Subheaders** - How notes are organized.
- Doulbe-hashtag (##) headers are for main sections, like chapters of a book or class sections
- Triple-hashtag (###) headers are for subsections, like concepts that have multiple parts
- Bold (\*\*) headers are for specific entries, like definitions or lists
**Syntax** - How notes look.
- Double and triple-hashtag headers should be capitalized and not punctuated
- Bold headers may have a small description ending with punctuization
- List entries should not have ending punctuization
**Note Notes** - Additional considerations.
- I'm not using spell-check, so there will be mistakes
